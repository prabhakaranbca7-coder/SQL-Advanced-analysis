Intermediate SQL - Sales Analysis
Overview
Analysis of customer behavior, retention, and lifetime value for an e-commerce company to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.

Business Questions
Customer Segmentation: Who are our most valuable customers?
Cohort Analysis: How do different customer groups generate revenue?
Retention Analysis: Which customers haven't purchased recently?
Analysis Approach
1. Customer Segmentation Analysis
Categorized customers based on total lifetime value (LTV)
Assigned customers to High, Mid, and Low-value segments
Calculated key metrics: total revenue
🖥️ Query: 1_customer_segmentation.sql

📈 Visualization:



📊 Key Findings:

High-value segment (25% of customers) drives 66% of revenue ($135.4M)
Mid-value segment (50% of customers) generates 32% of revenue ($66.6M)
Low-value segment (25% of customers) accounts for 2% of revenue ($4.3M)
💡 Business Insights

High-Value (66% revenue): Offer premium membership program to 12,372 VIP customers, as losing one customer significantly impacts revenue
Mid-Value (32% revenue): Create upgrade paths through personalized promotions, with potential $66.6M → $135.4M revenue opportunity
Low-Value (2% revenue): Design re-engagement campaigns and price-sensitive promotions to increase purchase frequency
2. Cohort Analysis
Tracked revenue and customer count per cohorts
Cohorts were grouped by year of first purchase
Analyzed customer retention at a cohort level
🖥️ Query: 2_cohort_analysis.sql

Cohort Analysis

📊 Key Findings:

Revenue per customer shows an alarming decreasing trend over time
2022-2024 cohorts are consistently performing worse than earlier cohorts
NOTE: Although net revenue is increasing, this is likely due to a larger customer base, which is not reflective of customer value
💡 Business Insights

Value extracted from customers is decreasing over time and needs further investigation.
In 2023 we saw a drop in number of customers acquired, which is concerning.
With both lowering LTV and decreasing customer acquisition, the company is facing a potential revenue decline.
3. Customer Retention
🖥️ Query: 3_retention_analysis.sql

Identified customers at risk of churning
Analyzed last purchase patterns
Calculated customer-specific metrics
📈 Visualization:

Customer Churn by Cohort Year

📊 Key Findings:

Cohort churn stabilizes at ~90% after 2-3 years, indicating a predictable long-term retention pattern.
Retention rates are consistently low (8-10%) across all cohorts, suggesting retention issues are systemic rather than specific to certain years.
Newer cohorts (2022-2023) show similar churn trajectories, signaling that without intervention, future cohorts will follow the same pattern.
💡 Business Insights:

Strengthen early engagement strategies to target the first 1-2 years with onboarding incentives, loyalty rewards, and personalized offers to improve long-term retention.
Re-engage high-value churned customers by focusing on targeted win-back campaigns rather than broad retention efforts, as reactivating valuable users may yield higher ROI.
Predict & preempt churn risk and use customer-specific warning indicators to proactively intervene with at-risk users before they lapse.
Strategic Recommendations
Customer Value Optimization (Customer Segmentation)

Launch VIP program for 12,372 high-value customers (66% revenue)

Cohort Performance Strategy (Customer Revenue by Cohort)

Target 2022-2024 cohorts with personalized re-engagement offers
Implement loyalty/subscription programs to stabilize revenue fluctuations
Apply successful strategies from high-spending 2016-2018 cohorts to newer customers
Retention & Churn Prevention (Customer Retention)

Strengthen first 1-2 year engagement with onboarding incentives and loyalty rewards
Focus on targeted win-back campaigns for high-value churned customers
Implement proactive intervention system for at-risk customers before they lapse
